        [1913 Webster]
  
     Syn: {Peculiar}, {Special}, {Especial}.
  
     Usage: Peculiar is from the Roman peculium, which was a thing
            emphatically and distinctively one's own, and hence
            was dear. The former sense always belongs to peculiar
            (as, a peculiar style, peculiar manners, etc.), and
            usually so much of the latter as to involve feelings
            of interest; as, peculiar care, watchfulness,
            satisfaction, etc. Nothing of this kind belongs to
            special and especial. They mark simply the relation of
            species to genus, and denote that there is something
            in this case more than ordinary; as, a special act of
            Congress; especial pains, etc.
            [1913 Webster]
  
                  Beauty, which, either walking or asleep,

                  For naught so vile that on the earth doth live,
                  But to the earth some special good doth give.
                                                    --Shak.
            [1913 Webster]

From Easton's 1897 Bible Dictionary [easton]:

  Peculiar
     as used in the phrase "peculiar people" in 1 Pet. 2:9, is
     derived from the Lat. peculium, and denotes, as rendered in the
     Revised Version ("a people for God's own possession"), a special
     possession or property. The church is the "property" of God, his
     "purchased possession" (Eph. 1:14; R.V., "God's own
     possession").
     

From Bouvier's Law Dictionary, Revised 6th Ed (1856) [bouvier]:
