### registers

Registers in Vim let you run actions or commands on text stored within them. To access a register, you type "a before a command, where a is the name of a register. If you want to copy the current line into register k, you can type
	"kyy

Or you can append to a register by using a capital letter:w

	"Kyy

You can then move through the document and paste it elsewhere using
	"kp
